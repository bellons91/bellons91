* Backend developer, focused on SharePoint (2014 -> 2016)
* Fullstack developer, taking care of everything: SQL, UI, and everything in between (2017)
* Fullstack developer/mentor: Angular + .NET API (2017->2019)
* Backend developer (2019 -> today)
* Backend dev/Architect (in the future - I hope üòâ)
